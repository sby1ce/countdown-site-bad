# Countdown
Set a countdown timer by either picking a date or pasting the date as text

# TODOs
## Important
- Make highlights for buttons when pressed to indicate the action went through
- Refactor
- Write tests

## Eventual (read: never)
- Migrate to TypeScript
- Migrate to Bun
- Add option to choose formats
- Make button to change between flex (priority timers first) and grid, as many timers on screen as possible (like Google Keep)
- Make automatic highlight of the smallest countdown
- Add changing timer priority like Steam wishlist (used to be. RIP)
- Optimize hour calculation
- Add option to add by time rather than by date
